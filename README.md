I'm Grayson, a statistics and data science educator, currently a Visiting Assitant Professor of Statistics at Reed College. My graduate education was pursued in the [Finley Lab](https://www.finley-lab.com) at Michigan State University, where I received an MS in Statistics and will complete my PhD in Forestry in 2026. Before coming to Michigan State, I received my BA in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics at Reed College. 

My research interests include small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, applications of statistical methods to forestry and natural resources problems, and statistical software development. 

Outside of academia, I've worked as a Data Scientist contracting with the USDA Forest Service and Data Science Educator at Posit. I also enjoy developing and maintaining R packages, some of which are highlighted below:

- [USDAForestService/FIESTA](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA): Forest Inventory Estimation and Analysis 
- [graysonwhite/gglm](https://github.com/graysonwhite/gglm): Grammar of Graphics for Linear Model Diagnostic Plots
- [graysonwhite/kbaabb](https://github.com/graysonwhite/kbaabb): A kNN-based approximation to the approximate Bayesian bootstrap

I enjoy exploring new places with my dog Dude, camping, cycling, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique.
