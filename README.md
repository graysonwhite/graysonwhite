I'm Grayson, a statistics and data science educator, beginning an appointment as a Visiting Assitant Professor of Statistics at Reed College in Fall 2025. My graduate education was pursued in the [Finley Lab](https://www.finley-lab.com) at Michigan State University, where I received an MS in Statistics and will complete my PhD in Forestry in 2026. Before coming to Michigan State, I received my BA in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics at Reed College. 

My research interests include hierarchical Bayesian modeling, small area estimation, applications of statistics to forestry, and education. 

Outside of research and academia, I've worked as a Data Scientist contracting with the USDA Forest Service and Data Science Educator at Posit. I also enjoy developing and maintaining R packages, some of which are highlighted below:

- [USDAForestService/FIESTA](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA): Forest Inventory Estimation and Analysis 
- [graysonwhite/gglm](https://github.com/graysonwhite/gglm): Grammar of Graphics for Linear Model Diagnostic Plots
- [graysonwhite/kbaabb](https://github.com/graysonwhite/kbaabb): A kNN-based approximation to the approximate Bayesian bootstrap

I enjoy exploring new places with my dog Dude, camping, cycling, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique.
