I'm Grayson, a graduate student pursuing a doctoral degree in Forestry and masters in Statistics in the [Finley Lab](https://www.finley-lab.com) at Michigan State University. Before coming to Michigan State, I received my BA in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics at Reed College. 

My research interests include hierarchical Bayesian modeling, small area estimation, applications of statistics to forestry, and education. For a list of my research (and other) endeavors see my [CV](https://graysonwhite.com/Grayson_White_CV.pdf). 

Outside of research and academia, I've worked as a Data Scientist contracting with the USDA Forest Service. I also enjoy developing and maintaining R packages, some of which are highlighted below:

- [USDAForestService/FIESTA](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA): Forest Inventory Estimation and Analysis 
- [graysonwhite/gglm](https://github.com/graysonwhite/gglm): Grammar of Graphics for Linear Model Diagnostic Plots
- [graysonwhite/kbaabb](https://github.com/graysonwhite/kbaabb): A kNN-based approximation to the approximate Bayesian bootstrap

I enjoy exploring new places with my dog Dude, camping, cycling, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique.
