### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Grayson, an incoming doctoral student (Statistics and Forestry) in the [Finley Lab](www.finley-lab.com) at Michigan State University. Previous to coming to Michigan State, I received my BA in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics at Reed College. 

I work on projects involving hierarchical Bayesian modeling, small area estimation, and statistical software.
